10 points

**DUE: Friday, May 16 by 5:00pm**

### Instructions

Re-implement the Watch Party single page application from Exercise 6, this time using React to manage the state and render the page components.

### Rubric
- Implement all the behaviors of Exercise 6
- Create React Components for each of the navigation pages: splash, profile, login, and room
- Create a React Component for the chat in a single room
- Create a React Component for a single chat message
- Correctly assign each component in a list a unique key property.
- Use `useState` to track whether the user is logged in and render the appropriate components
- Use `useState` to track what page the user is on and render the appropriate components. Do not use a router library.
- Use `useState` to track the names of rooms and the messages in each room.
- Pass state down to at least one component as props
- Pass state down to at least on component with `useContext`

Borrow liberally from your work on Exercise 6 and Lab 7
